Learn how to develop multithreaded event-driven IoT C applications that scale from embedded [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) to [Raspberry Pis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), to desktop-class computers.\\n1. A fantastic safe way to explore Intel 8080 machine-level programming and Assembly programming, along with C and BASIC development.\\n1. If you are interested in retro gaming, chill out playing retro games from yesteryear.\\n\\n## Cloud services integration\\n\\nOptionally, the project integrates free weather and pollution cloud services from Open Weather Map, Azure IoT Central, and Azure Anomaly Detection Cognitive Service. The following reports were generated from data published by the Altair emulator using data sourced from Open Weather Map.\\n\\n| IoT Central Sydney pollution report | Azure Anomaly Detection report|\\n|------|-----|\\n| ![The images shows pollution report for Sydney](../static/img/png/iot_central_pollution_report.png) | ![The following images shows temperature based anomalies](../static/img/png/univariate-anomalies.png) |\\n\\n## Get Started\\n\\nHead to the [Altair Everywhere](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Altair8800.Emulator.UN-X/wiki) repo, get started, have some fun, learn new skills, and impress your friends and family :)\\n\\n## Altair History\\n\\n![The image shows the Altair 8800](../static/img/png/altair-8800-smithsonian-museum.png)\\n\\n[Altair 8800 image attribution - Smithsonian Museum](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Altair_8800,_Smithsonian_Museum.jpg)\\n\\nThe Altair 8800 was built on the [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080?azure-portal=true) CPU, the second 8-bit microprocessor manufactured by Intel in 1974. By today\'s standards, it\'s a simple CPU design, perfect for learning computing fundamentals because of its small instruction set.\\n\\nThe original Altair 8800 was programmed by setting switches on the front panel. It was a painstaking, error-prone process to load and run a program. The Altair 8800 had a series of LEDs and switches that you used to load apps and determine the state of the Altair.\\n\\nYou could save and load applications from a paper tape reader connected to the Altair 8800. As the Altair 8800 grew in popularity, more options became available. You could attach a keyboard, a computer monitor, and disk drives, a more reliable way to save and load applications."},{"id":"julyot-day4","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/julyot-day4","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-04-iot-north.md","title":"04: Detect the very big with the very small \u2013 counting bears with TinyML meetup from IoT North","description":"Welcome to Day 4 of #JulyOT!!","date":"2022-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 4, 2022","tags":[{"label":"30days","permalink":"/blog/tags/30-days"},{"label":"iot","permalink":"/blog/tags/iot"},{"label":"aiatedge","permalink":"/blog/tags/aiatedge"}],"readingTime":2.25,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Bennett","title":"Senior Regional Cloud Advocate @Microsoft","url":"https://github.com/jimbobbennett","imageURL":"https://github.com/jimbobbennett.png","key":"jimb"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"julyot-day4","title":"04: Detect the very big with the very small \u2013 counting bears with TinyML meetup from IoT North","authors":["jimb"],"tags":["30days","iot","aiatedge"],"draft":false},"prevItem":{"title":"05: Altair Everywhere","permalink":"/blog/julyot-day5-embedded"},"nextItem":{"title":"02: IoT for beginners","permalink":"/blog/julyot-day2"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://julyot.dev/blog/julyot-day4\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"IoT North meetup\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"Detect the very big with the very small \u2013 counting bears with TinyML meetup from IoT North\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://julyot.dev/img/png/JulyOT-banner-4-iot-north.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:creator\\" content=\\"@jimbobbennett\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@AzureAdvocates\\" /> \\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://julyot.dev/blog/julyot-day4\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n> Welcome to Day 4 of **#JulyOT**!!\\n\\n![Page banner](/img/png/JulyOT-banner-4-iot-north.png)\\n\\n# Detect the very big with the very small \u2013 counting bears with TinyML meetup from IoT North\\n\\nToday we have a sneak peek at a meetup coming tomorrow (5th July), to give you time to sign up and join!

Come and talk about your projects, what you\'re working on and share experiences.\\n\\nNow a part of IoT North - www.IoTNorth.uk - giving businesses a North in IoT\\n\\n## What this meetup is about\\n\\nJim left the UK a few years ago to move to the Pacific North West of the US. Back in the UK the scariest animal he might have encountered would be a sudden hedgehog, but in Washington State where he lives it seems there are bears! He even lost an apple tree and a fence to one once.\\n\\nA useful tool for him would be a bear detector \u2013 a device to alert him if there are bears in the garden. Such a tool could be built using an AI model trained in the cloud and running on a powerful computer. But who wants to risk a powerful computer outside when there are bears?\\n\\nWhat if he could run a bear detector on a relatively inexpensive microcontroller, then see the results on a cloud dashboard?\\n\\nThis is where TinyML comes in! TinyML is shrinking AI models down very small, as in kilobytes in size, then running them on low power microcontrollers, or tiny computers like a Raspberry Pi Zero.\\n\\nIn this session Jim will train a bear detector using [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com), an on-line development platform for TinyML models, taking advantage of their new FOMO object detection model. He\u2019ll then show how to run this model on a low powered device, uploading the detection results to an Azure IoT Central dashboard.\\n\\nBy the end of this session, you will have an understanding of TinyML, how to train models, how to visualize data, and just how wary of bears Jim actually is\u2026"},{"id":"julyot-day2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/julyot-day2","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-02.mdx","title":"02: IoT for beginners","description":"Welcome to Day 2 of #JulyOT!!","date":"2022-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"30days","permalink":"/blog/tags/30-days"},{"label":"iot","permalink":"/blog/tags/iot"},{"label":"iot4b","permalink":"/blog/tags/iot-4-b"}],"readingTime":1.765,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Bennett","title":"Senior Regional Cloud Advocate @Microsoft","url":"https://github.com/jimbobbennett","imageURL":"https://github.com/jimbobbennett.png","key":"jimb"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"julyot-day2","title":"02: IoT for beginners","authors":["jimb"],"tags":["30days","iot","iot4b"],"draft":false},"prevItem":{"title":"04: Detect the very big with the very small \u2013 counting bears with TinyML meetup from IoT North","permalink":"/blog/julyot-day4"},"nextItem":{"title":"01: Getting started with nanoFramework!","permalink":"/blog/01-nano-framework"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://julyot.dev/blog/julyot-day2\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"IoT for beginners!\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"Spend your weekend learning with IoT for beginners!\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://julyot.dev/img/png/JulyOT-banner-2-iot-for-beginners.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:creator\\" content=\\"@jimbobbennett\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@AzureAdvocates\\" /> \\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://julyot.dev/blog/julyot-day2\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n> Welcome to Day 2 of **#JulyOT**!! \\n\\n![Page banner](/img/png/JulyOT-banner-2-iot-for-beginners.png)\\n\\nAs we go into the first weekend of July, and a long weekend for some, there\'s no better time to brush up on your basics.\\n\\nFor day 2 of #JulyOT we are dipping into the archives to bring you [IoT for Beginners](https://aka.ms/iot-beginners), a 12-week, 24-lesson free and open source IoT curriculum to teach you IoT from the ground up.

This free and Open Source platform enables the writing of managed code applications for constrained embedded devices. As a developer, you can use your powerful and familiar tools like Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and your .NET C# skills to write code on a microcontroller.\\n\\n.NET nanoFramework supports a large variety of Micro Controller Units (MCU): STM32, ESP32, TI, and NXP. The .NET nanoFramework provides access to low-level IO and protocols, as well as networking and advanced security features allowing connection to the Cloud.\\n\\nHere you\'ll find all the tools, examples, documentation and a great developer ecosystem to help you on your next embedded systems project.\\n\\n> **New**: Adoption of .NET nanoFramework is growing fast. It just reached 2 million NuGet downloads, it took 5 years to reach the first million and only 9 months for the second one! Read more about it [here](https://www.nanoframework.net/2-million-nuget-downloads-and-counting/)\\n\\nTo get started, you can use our [step by step guide](https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/getting-started-guides/getting-started-managed.html) containing as well short videos.\\n\\nYou\'ll go through the installation of the Visual Studio extension:\\n\\n![step by step](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/getting-started-guides/getting-started-extension-installation.gif)\\n\\nThen installing `nanoff`, the tool to flash your device, and flashing your device:\\n\\n![install and flash nanoff](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/getting-started-guides/getting-started-install-nanoff-flash-esp32.gif)\\n\\nAnd then coding your first hello .NET nanoFramework application and setting debug breakpoints in your code:\\n\\n![Hello nano](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/getting-started-guides/getting-started-first-project.gif)\\n\\nIn a matter of a few minutes, you\'ll be up and running with .NET nanoFramework!\\n\\nAnd a lot of samples to start: <https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples>\\n\\n## What is .NET nanoFramework?\\n\\n.NET **nanoFramework** is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) platform that enables the writing of managed code applications for constrained [embedded devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system). It is suitable for many types of projects including IoT sensors, wearables, academic proof of concept, robotics, hobbyist/makers creations, or even complex industrial equipment. The .NET nanoFramework makes development easier, faster, and less costly by giving embedded developers access to modern technologies and tools used by desktop application developers.\\n\\nDevelopers can harness the powerful and familiar [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/?wt.mc_id=eventspg_16482_webpage_reactor) and their [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) knowledge to quickly write code without having to worry about the low-level hardware intricacies of a microcontroller. Desktop .NET developers will feel \u201cat home\u201d and can use their skills in embedded systems development, enlarging the pool of qualified embedded developers. Using Microsoft Visual Studio, a developer can deploy and debug the code directly on real hardware.\\n\\nThe .NET nanoFramework includes a reduced version of the .NET [Common Language Runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) (CLR) and features a subset of the .NET base class libraries along with the most common APIs included in [.NET IoT](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/?wt.mc_id=eventspg_16482_webpage_reactor) allowing code reuse from .NET IoT applications, thousands of code examples, and open source projects.\\n\\nThe project is supported by the .NET Foundation.\\n\\nYou can watch this video from the Microsoft [IoT Show](https://aka.ms/iotshow) featuring .NET nanoFramework connected to Azure IoT Hub, measuring a [BMP280 sensors](https://docs.nanoframework.net/devices/Iot.Device.Bmxx80.Bmp280.html), and using the unique deep sleep feature from microcontrollers. A real-life example with .NET nanoFramework:\\n\\n[![IoT Show](/img/jpg/nanoframework-iot-show.jpg)](https://docs.microsoft.com/shows/internet-of-things-show/introduction-to-net-nanoframework?wt.mc_id=eventspg_16482_webpage_reactor)\\n\\n## Why use .NET nanoFramework?\\n\\n.NET **nanoFramework** is the perfect enabler for developing software that works on embedded devices. Start with a low-cost and readily available development board, then use nanoFramework to write, debug and deploy your code.\\n\\nWhether this is your first foray into programming or you are a seasoned developer, if you want a powerful and easy-to-use tool for developing software that runs on embedded devices, you are in the right place. With its modular architecture, it\'s easy to grab the core components (like the CLR, debugger, and interpreter) and extend them to new hardware platforms, .NET nanoFramework is the perfect partner for your project. The current reference implementation uses [ChibiOS](http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php) supporting several [ST Microelectronics](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html) development boards, Espressif [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32), Texas Instruments [CC3220 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL), [CC1352 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1), and NXP [MIMXRT1060-EVK](https://www.nxp.com/part/MIMXRT1060-EVK#/).\\n\\nBecause it\'s completely [free and Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) you have access to and the ability to modify all parts of the code including the ability to leverage what others have already contributed. If you are willing to, you can help shape the future by contributing back to the project and rapidly growing community.\\n\\nHere are a couple of supported boards:\\n\\n![nucleo](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/reference-targets/nucleo64-f091rc.jpg)![esp32](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/reference-targets/esp32-devkitc.jpg)![M5Stack](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/reference-targets/m5stack.jpg)![OrgPall PalThree](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/reference-targets/orgpal-palthree.jpg)![NXP](https://docs.nanoframework.net/images/reference-targets/mimxrt1060_evk.jpg)\\n\\nOur reference boards can be found [here](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter#net-nanoframework-interpreter-for-reference-boards). And community boards [here](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-Community-Targets#available-community-boards). Depending on your board, it can be a matter of a few hours to get your board supported! A blog post will explain how.\\n\\nHere are some of its unique features:\\n\\n* Can run on resource-constrained devices with as low as 128kB of flash and 64kB of RAM.\\n* Runs directly on bare metal. Currently, [ARM Cortex-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-M) and [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) devices are supported.\\n* Supports common embedded peripherals and interconnects like GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, USB, and networking.\\n* Provides multi-threading support natively.\\n* Support for energy-efficient operations such as devices running on batteries.\\n* Support for Interop code allows developers to easily write libraries that have both managed (C#) and native code (C/C++).\\n* No manual memory management because of its simpler mark-and-sweep [garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)).\\n* Execution constraints to catch device lockups and crashes.\\n\\nHere are some advantages over other similar systems:\\n\\n* First-class debugger experience right on the target hardware with breakpoints, single step, step into, step out, step over, pause and stop.\\n* Powerful and free developer tools with [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/?wt.mc_id=eventspg_16482_webpage_reactor).\\n* Support for a large range of inexpensive boards from several manufacturers including Discovery and Nucleo boards from [ST Microelectronics](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html), [Quail](https://www.mikroe.com/quail) from Mikrobus, [Netduino](https://www.wildernesslabs.co/Netduino) from Wilderness Labs, [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) DevKit C, Texas Instruments [CC3220 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL), [CC1352 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1), and NXP [MIMXRT1060-EVK](https://www.nxp.com/part/MIMXRT1060-EVK#/).\\n* Easily expandable to other hardware and [RTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system) platforms. Currently targets [CMSIS](https://developer.arm.com/embedded/cmsis) and ESP32 FreeRTOS ports.\\n* Completely free and Open Source. From the core components to the utilities used for building, deploying, debugging, and IDE components.\\n\\n## Associated links:\\n\\n* Official .NET nanoFramework [site and blog](https://www.nanoframework.net/).\\n* [All our documentation](https://docs.nanoframework.net/) for API, classes, how to install, build your own images, architecture, and more!.\\n* THE place to go to get any code: our [Github .NET nanoFramework](https://github.com/nanoframework).\\n\\nFind us on Fridays all July! See you for another post on how to use GPIO, SPI, I2C, PWM, and more on .NET nanoFramework! And feedback is welcome."},{"id":"01-julyot-kickoff","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/01-julyot-kickoff","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-01.md","title":"01: Welcome to #JulyOT!","description":"Welcome to Day 1 of #JulyOT!!","date":"2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 1, 2022","tags":[{"label":"30days","permalink":"/blog/tags/30-days"},{"label":"iot","permalink":"/blog/tags/iot"},{"label":"kickoff","permalink":"/blog/tags/kickoff"},{"label":"iot4b","permalink":"/blog/tags/iot-4-b"},{"label":"embeddediot","permalink":"/blog/tags/embeddediot"},{"label":"aiatedge","permalink":"/blog/tags/aiatedge"},{"label":"iotcerts","permalink":"/blog/tags/iotcerts"}],"readingTime":2.145,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Bennett","title":"Senior Regional Cloud Advocate @Microsoft","url":"https://github.com/jimbobbennett","imageURL":"https://github.com/jimbobbennett.png","key":"jimb"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"01-julyot-kickoff","title":"01: Welcome to #JulyOT!","authors":["jimb"],"tags":["30days","iot","kickoff","iot4b","embeddediot","aiatedge","iotcerts"],"draft":false},"prevItem":{"title":"01: Getting started with nanoFramework!","permalink":"/blog/01-nano-framework"},"nextItem":{"title":"00: #JulyOT Is Coming!","permalink":"/blog/julyot-teaser"}},"content":"<head>\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:url\\" content=\\"https://julyot.dev/blog/01-julyot-kickoff\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:title\\" content=\\"Day 1 of #JulyOT!\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:description\\" content=\\"Jumpstart 31 days of IoT celebrations with #JulyOT\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:image\\" content=\\"https://julyot.dev/img/png/JulyOT-banner-1-welcome.png\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:card\\" content=\\"summary_large_image\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:creator\\" content=\\"@jimbobbennett\\" />\\n  <meta name=\\"twitter:site\\" content=\\"@AzureAdvocates\\" /> \\n  <link rel=\\"canonical\\" href=\\"https://julyot.dev/blog/01-julyot-kickoff\\" />\\n</head>\\n\\n> Welcome to Day 1 of **#JulyOT**!!\\n\\n![Welcome banner](/img/png/JulyOT-banner-1-welcome.png)\\n\\n#JulyOT 2022 is finally here, and we are excited to share 31 days of IoT goodness throughout this month.\\n\\nEach weekday we will be publishing one or more articles here all grouped into the following themes:\\n\\n* Beginners, makers, and students\\n* Embedded development\\n* AI on the Edge\\n* Learning and certifications\\n\\nSome will be full blog posts, others will direct you to videos, GitHub repos, other blogs, or code samples.\\n\\nCheck back here every day for more IoT goodness.\\n\\n## In this post\\n\\n* [**Upskill by joining the IoT Cloud skills challenge**](#iot-cloud-skills-challenge)\\n* [**Learn IoT with IoT For Beginners**](#iot-for-beginners)\\n* [**Digital swag**](#digital-swag)\\n\\n## IoT Cloud Skills Challenge\\n\\nWant to become a subject matter in the IoT Domain?
