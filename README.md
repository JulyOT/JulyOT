# #JulyOT

The central repository for all content released as part of #JulyOT each year.

To run this repo locally to test out changes:

* Open this either using CodeSpaces, or open using the Remote Container extension in VS Code. This way all the required components will be installed.
* Navigate to the `doc` folder, then run:

  ```sh
  yarn install
  ```
  
  This will download and configure everything.
 
 * Launch the site using:

  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```
 
 * The site will be built and deployed, and launched. If you are using CodeSpaces, it will connect to the host running in the code space.
 * This supports live updates, so any changes are automatically populated to the app, just make your changes and refresh the page.
