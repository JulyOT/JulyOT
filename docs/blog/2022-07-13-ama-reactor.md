## Ask Me Anything at Reactor: Azure IoT

This session is part of a series of Ask Me Anything at Reactor sessions that are giving us a platform to share stories, listen, ask respectful questions, and continue on our journey to improve and collaborate with User Groups and Online Communities.

Join us as we welcome our speakers Bruno Capuano and Maria-Anastasia Moustaka to the Ask Me Anything stage. They will be sharing their knowledge on Azure IoT and a variety of other topics.
