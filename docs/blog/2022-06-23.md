> #JulyOT is coming!

![Jumpstart 31 days of IoT celebrations with #JulyOT](../static/img/png/julyot-kickoff-banner.png)

We can't believe it's already the last week of June!! Wait - you know what that means right?

Clear up your cables, dust off your Raspberry Pi, dig our your Arduino board, fire up Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO, or the Arduino IDE, and login to the cloud! It's almost time to celebrate the Internet of Things, one thing at a time! It's almost #JulyOT!

As always #JulyOT will be kicking off on the 1st July, and every day we will be bringing you some awesome IoT content to get you excited about the Internet of Things.

We'll have a mix of live streams, videos, blog posts and code samples, all grouped into the following themes:

* Beginners, makers, and students
* Embedded development
* AI on the Edge
* Learning and certifications

We invite everyone to build and share your creations throughout month as you gain knowledge from these and other resources throughout #JulyOT!  Be sure to spread the word about this initiative and your own projects by sharing the [hashtag #JulyOT on social media](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JulyOT)! We'll be sharing our favorite projects that we find.

Check back here daily to get all the latest goodness, or subscribe to [our RSS feed](https://julyot.dev/blog/rss.xml).

## #JulyOT has a new home!

In the past #JulyOT has lived on the [Microsoft IoT Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/bg-p/IoTBlog), but going forward we have a new home - here at [JulyOT.dev](https://julyOT.dev).

All the content for #JulyOT now lives [in GitHub](https://github.com/JulyOT/JulyOT). If you want to submit content then join us there, raise an issue with what you want to add, and we can help get your content shared with the world. For blog posts you can write the whole post here, or link out to your own blog. For all other content we can link to your GitHub repo, video or wherever!
