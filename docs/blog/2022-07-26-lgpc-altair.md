_Investigate the modern world of ‘personal’ computing, from IoT to mobile, mixed reality, desktop computing, wearables, and more!_

## Let's get personal: computing

Today we are announcing our new series on YouTube, recorded at the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond!

Let's get personal: computing is an interview show where [Jim Bennett](https://twitter.com/JimBobBennett) interviews guests who have been working in the modern version of personal computing, covering IoT to mobile, mixed reality, desktop computing, wearables, and more. Each guest has built something cool that they want to share that you too can build!

On this show, Jim is joined by [Dave Glover](https://twitter.com/dglover), an internet of things and embedded hardware enthusiast from Australia, who has built a pocket-sized Altair 8800! A piece of computing history in the palm of your hand.
