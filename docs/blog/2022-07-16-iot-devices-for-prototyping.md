_Today we share a list of IoT devices for prototyping your IoT application._

## IoT devices for prototyping

The MakeIt team at Microsoft is there to support the maker community, helping you to get your makes and prototypes built quicker with the best in class tools you need.

One way we are helping makers is sharing a list of IoT devices for prototyping your IoT application. This list aims to give partners a starting point with IoT hardware to build prototypes and proof-of-concepts quickly and easily.

This list is in an Excel spreadsheet, and is available from the [Microsoft Maker Community Resources repo on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MakerCommunityResources).

<form action="https://github.com/microsoft/MakerCommunityResources/raw/main/IoT/IoT%20Device%20Selection%20List%20for%20Prototyping.xlsx" target="_blank">
    <input type="submit" value="Download the list from GitHub" class="clean-btn button button--primary margin-left--md"/>
