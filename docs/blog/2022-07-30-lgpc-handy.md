_Investigate the modern world of ‘personal’ computing, from IoT to mobile, mixed reality, desktop computing, wearables, and more!_

## Let's get personal: computing

Today we are announcing a second episode on our new series on YouTube, recorded at the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond!

Let's get personal: computing is an interview show where [Jim Bennett](https://twitter.com/JimBobBennett) interviews guests who have been working in the modern version of personal computing, covering IoT to mobile, mixed reality, desktop computing, wearables, and more. Each guest has built something cool that they want to share that you too can build!

On today’s show, Jim is joined by [Cliff Agius](https://twitter.com/CliffordAgius), a pilot and IoT and mobile developer from the UK. He’s mixed the power of 3D modeling software, consumer 3D printers, low priced IoT hardware and a mobile app to build an open source bionic hand that can be customized for a range of tasks, from picking things up, to playing Xbox.
