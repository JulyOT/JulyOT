_Today we learn more about Azure Percept._

# Learn Azure Percept from conference sessions

Azure Percept is a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform with added security for creating edge AI solutions.

Start your proof of concept in minutes with hardware accelerators built to integrate seamlessly with Azure AI and Azure IoT services.

Azure Percept works out of the box with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Machine Learning, and other Azure services to deliver vision and audio insights in real time.

To help you learn more about Azure Percept, we've curated a set of recorded sessions and blog posts from 3 different conferences.

## Microsoft Ignite 2021

### Automate Your Operations with Edge AI

Automating your operations doesn’t need to be a challenge—and it’s something you can do today. Join this session with NVIDIA and Microsoft to discover how you can use Edge AI for your automation needs. We will provide a behind-the-scenes look at the technology making it all possible, including Microsoft Azure Percept and Azure Stack HCI. Select partners and solution providers will also join us to share more about the innovative hardware that you can run in your edge location.

### Microsoft and NVIDIA partner to accelerate edge AI deployment

In a journey to understand the typical edge AI deployment journey, Microsoft spoke to over 500 customers and partners about their biggest barriers to entry. We heard about complexities when trying to scale, no end-to-end solution platforms, even security concerns. With these findings in mind, we released Azure Percept DK to public preview in Spring 2021. It's now [available to customers in 16 markets](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-percept-dk-and-azure-percept-audio-now-available-in-more/ba-p/2712969?wt.mc_id=eventspg_16482_webpage_reactor) around the world.
