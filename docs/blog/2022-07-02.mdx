IoT for Beginners is split into 6 projects, each one teaching important IoT concepts and coupled with you actually building something. The projects follow the path from farm to table, showing how IoT can improve the journey food makes, and covering industrial IoT, digital agriculture, AI on the edge, retail IoT, and consumer IoT.

* Introduction - build an IoT nightlight
* Digital agriculture - build an automated watering system
* Logistics - build a vehicle tracker with a dashboard and location alerts
* Manufacturing - use AI on the edge to build a fruit monitor
* Retail - use AI on the edge to do stock monitoring
* Consumer - build a voice controlled smart timer
